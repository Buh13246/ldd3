# Linux Device Drivers 3 Source Code
My Source Code writen by following the LDD3 (Linux Device Drivers 3) book (https://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/)`

All parts are either Code parts in the book or written by me. I didn't want to look into the original source code (to improve the learn effect)

## Currently implemented Parts
### hello
Simple hello world kernel module

### scull
A reimplementation of the scull driver
